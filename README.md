# LoadAvg Tool

## Demo for my session at 2nd Python Meetup in Palermo

A simple tool that reads your last 5s, prints it to screen, saves
it into a SQLite database and publishes it into a Redis pubsub
channel

---

How to use it:

- Install Docker
- Install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com)
- Install the *Remote Development* extension pack inside Visual Studio Code
- Clone the repo
- Open the repo in Visual Studio Code
- Select "Remote-Containers: Reopen in Container" from the command palette (F1 or ctrl/cmd + shift + P) or from the notification that appears in the bottom right
